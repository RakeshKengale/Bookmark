- **Developing a High-Performance Web Application Using PHP, MySQL, and Modern Frontend Technologies:**
```cmd
I want to create a school project involving a web application that utilizes PHP, MySQL, Ajax, SweetAlert 2, DataTables (JavaScript table library), parameterized queries, and PDO. The project should include the following features:

1. User Authentication and Authorization:
   - Implement user authentication using php.
   - Ensure role-based access control and permissions.

2. Database Operations:
   - Use MySQL for the database.
   - Apply parameterized queries with PDO for secure database interactions.

3. Frontend Features:
   - Use Ajax to fetch and submit data asynchronously.
   - Integrate SweetAlert 2 for user-friendly alerts and confirmations.
   - Display data in an interactive table using DataTables.

4. Backend Logic:
   - Implement PHP scripts to handle data processing and interactions with the database.

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize code for better performance and application speed.
   - Implement caching strategies where appropriate.
   - Minimize and optimize database queries.
   - Optimize front-end resources such as JavaScript and CSS files.
   - Ensure efficient use of Ajax requests to reduce server load and enhance responsiveness.

Specific Requirements:
- User Registration and Login: Allow users to register and log in. Implement role-based access where certain features are restricted based on user roles.
- CRUD Operations: Create a system where users can create, read, update, and delete records. Display these records in a DataTable.
- Validation and Alerts: Use SweetAlert 2 to show success or error messages after form submissions or data operations.
- Asynchronous Data Handling: Use Ajax for fetching and submitting data without page reloads.
- Code Optimization: Review and refactor code to improve efficiency. Focus on minimizing redundant operations, optimizing query performance, and ensuring fast load times.

Please provide a detailed guide or code examples for integrating these technologies into the project, focusing on best practices for security, performance, and speed.
